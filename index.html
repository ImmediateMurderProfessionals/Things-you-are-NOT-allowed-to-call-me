    <h2>Things you are not allowed to call me</h2>
    <p><i>WARNING: Some of these things that you are not allowed to call me are vulgar or offensive. If something is offensive, do not call anyone by that name, not just me.</i></p>
    <p>This is a site listing a bunch of things you are NOT allowed to call me. If someone calls me a name on this list, refer them to this site. If a thing is listed on this site, you also can't call me any variations of that thing (e.g. if "He who must not be named" is on this site, "He who probably must not be named" is also not allowed. Similarly, if "idiot" is on this site, "fucking idiot" is also not allowed.)</p>
